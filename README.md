# Blackjack

This is a small practice project I wanted to try to keep my C++ skills fresh that I will work on when I get time. It is a blackjack game that is played from the consle and prompts you for a bet, then gives you (and the dealer) a hand, and let's you hit or stay. 

## Left to do

I still need to make the ACE able to be either a 1 or 11, since now it is currently fixed at 1 or 11 and cannot be adjusted. I also want improve the dealer betting strategy, since as of now it just hits on anything below a 15 and stays above a 15 which is not very accurate. Lastly, I want to improve what the console output shows when you are dealt a hand and when you win/lose.
